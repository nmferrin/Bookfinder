        Welcome to my bookfinder project. This is my first capstone project with the Springboard bootcamp using
        the Open Library API to retrieve the book information to be saved onto the application's database and make reading lists.
        The application uses Flask along with Python, a bit of Javascript, and Tailwind for styling.
